## What is Hosted Desktop?

Hosted Desktop is a service that allows you to access a Windows desktop from any device, anywhere in the world. It is a great way to access your files and applications from home, or on the go.

## How do I access Hosted Desktop?

Once the old boring stuff is out of the way, you will be provided an IP address and login details to access your desktop. 
You can access your desktop by using a Remote Desktop Client.

### The best way to access Hosted Desktop

The best way to access Hosted Desktop is by using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client. This is available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. You can download the client from the following links:
